/*==============================================================================
 * The BGP Finite State Machine
 *
 * The working of BGP is described in the RFC (4271) in terms of a finite
 * state machine.  This code attempts to follow the states and events
 * described in the RFC.
 *
 * Some events are queued when they are generated, and it may be a while before
 * they are actioned.  This creates a potential problem: a later event might be
 * rendered "stale" or even invalid by a state change caused by an earlier one
 * -- or, to put it another way, when an event is generated it cannot know that
 * the state may be (effectively) out of date.
 *
 * Some, high priority, events are set by bits in the 'meta_events' in the
 * connection, and these take precedence over all other events.  This, in
 * particular, is how feOpenCollisionDump is sent, ensuring that the
 * connection gets the message before doing anything else.
 *
 * Other, low priority, events are also set by bits in the 'meta_events', in
 * particular all timer events are handled in this way, so that they can be
 * discarded readily if when "stale".
 *
 * Events may be generated by:
 *
 *   * external agency -- in particular enabling and disabling sessions.
 *
 *     These map to feManualStart and feManualStop.
 *
 *     These may be generated at any time and are not dependent on the state
 *     of the FSM when they are generated.  So, the FSM deals with them in
 *     whatever state it is in when it gets to them.
 *
 *   * connection acceptor
 *
 *     Which runs asynchronously, so all states must be ready to process the
 *     event.
 *
 *     There are two events which can affect the FSM:
 *
 *       * feAccepted
 *
 *         which applies only to the secondary (in-bound) connection, or to the
 *         primary connection once the session is established.
 *
 *         If the connection is not up, this is good news:
 *
 *           This can only be in fsActive when it is not delaying_open.
 *
 *           In this state there can be no feIO events !
 *
 *         If the connection is up, this may be bad news:
 *
 *           For fsActive (delaying_open), fsOpenSent and fsOpenConfirm, the
 *           effect of the new in-coming connection is to cause the existing
 *           connection to be dropped.
 *
 *           For fsEstablished the effect depends on Graceful Restart (RFC4724).
 *           If is Graceful Restart, then the current connection and session
 *           will be dropped.  If is not Graceful Restart then the accept()
 *           does not affect the current session, and the event will be ignored.
 *
 *       * feAcceptedOPEN
 *
 *         which applies only if the session is fsEstablished.
 *
 *         Or would apply if we supported CollisionDetectEstablishedState, but
 *         we don't.
 *
 *     Now, the question is what to do if these events are raised before or
 *     after other events for the connection.  These events are asynchronous,
 *     so when we see a new in-bound connection, we do not know whether it
 *     actually occurred before or after any activity on the existing
 *     connection which we may have now seen.  By RFC we expect the far end
 *     to only open up a new connection once it is done with any earlier one,
 *     so we deem all activity we can see on the existing connection to have
 *     occurred first.
 *
 *     So, these are handled as 'meta_events', with a lower priority than
 *     other I/O events, but higher priority than timers.
 *
 *   * I/O
 *
 *     Actual I/O is performed by qfile action, and is limited to the physical
 *     read/write of bytes.  This may (well) generate an feIO (non-RFC) event.
 *
 *     The feIO event is dealt with specially, just before the FSM proper.
 *     If is fsEstablished, then the feIO handler deals with KEEPALIVE and
 *     UPDATE messages and the HoldTimer.  At other times, and for all other
 *     messages and I/O events, each call of the feIO handler may generate at
 *     most one event, which is promptly given to the FSM.  When the FSM
 *     returns, any further feIO stuff will be processed.  (The FSM may, in a
 *     very few cases, push a follow-on event onto the queue, which will be
 *     processed before any further feIO stuff.)
 *
 *     Each time the feIO event handler is invoked, the writer is checked and
 *     any the writer buffer topped up, if possible.
 *
 *     EOF and I/O errors are picked up the feIO event handling -- they are
 *     not reported directly as events.
 *
 *   * timers
 *
 *     The timer action functions set fmXXXX 'meta_events' as required.
 *
 *     Timer events have the lowest priority, and may be discarded on state
 *     change and are discarded when the timer is stopped.
 *
 *   * internally
 *
 *     The processing of one event may generate further event(s), for the FSM
 *     itself and (in a few cases) for the sibling FSM.
 *
 *     Events generated by an FSM for itself are pushed onto the front of the
 *     event queue, so the FSM can ensure that there aren't any state issues.
 *
 *     One FSM may generate feOpenCollisionDump for another -- which is
 *     handled as a high priority meta_event.
 *
 * In general the FSM manages connections, but there is some interaction with
 * the session, particularly when connections enter/leave fsEstablished !
 *
 * TODO: restore NSF
 *
 *------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Connect and Accept (aka Active) Connections
 *
 * To support BGP's "symmetrical" open strategy, this code allows for two
 * connections to be made for a session -- one connect() and one accept().
 * If two connections are made, only one will reach fsOpenConfirm state and
 * hence fsEstablished.
 *
 * When a session is enabled, the allowed connections are initialised and
 * an feManualStart event issued for each one.
 *
 * The listeners (in bgp_network) will only accept connections from addresses
 * known to be peer addresses, and then only when the FSM is ready for them.
 * The accept field in the peer_index entry (see bgp_peer_index) is maintained
 * by this code -- the accept field (when set) points to the secondary
 * connection of the session.
 *
 * As per the RFC, collision detection/resolution is performed when an OPEN
 * message is received -- that is, as the connection attempts to advance to
 * sOpenConfirm state.  At that point, if the sibling is in sOpenConfirm state,
 * then one of the two connections is closed (and will go sIdle once the
 * NOTIFICATION has been sent).
 *
 * See below for a discussion of the fall back to sIdle -- the losing connection
 * will remain comatose until the winner either reaches sEstablished (when the
 * loser is snuffed out) or the winner falls back to sIdle (when the
 * IdleHoldTimer for the loser is set, and it will wake up in due course).
 *
 * NB: the RFC talks of matching source/destination and destination/source
 *     addresses of connections in order to detect collisions.  This code
 *     uses only the far end address to detect collisions.  It does so
 *     implicitly because the in-bound connection is matched with the out-
 *     bound one using the peer's known IP address -- effectively its name.
 *
 *     [It is not deemed relevant if the local addresses for the in- and out-
 *      bound connections are different.]
 *
 *     The RFC further says "the local system MUST examine all of its
 *     connections that are in OpenConfirm state" ... "If, among these
 *     connections, there is a connection to a remote BGP speaker whose BGP
 *     identifier equals the one in the OPEN message, and this connection
 *     collides with [it]" ... then must resolve the collision.
 *
 *     This code almost does this, but:
 *
 *       * there can only be one connection that collides (i.e. only one other
 *         which has the same remote end address), and that is the sibling
 *         connection.
 *
 *         So there's not a lot of "examining" to be done.
 *
 *       * the RFC seems to accept that there could be two distinct connections
 *         with the same remote end address, but *different* BGP Identifiers.
 *
 *         As far as Quagga is concerned, that is impossible.  The remote end
 *         IP address is the name of the peering session, and there cannot
 *         be two peering sessions with the same name.  It follows that Quagga
 *         requires that the "My AS" and the "BGP Identifier" entries in the
 *         OPEN messages from a given remote end IP address MUST MATCH !
 *
 *------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The FSM proceeds in three basic phases:
 *
 *   1) attempting to establish a TCP connection: sIdle/sActive/sConnect
 *
 *      In this phase there is no connection for the other end to close !
 *
 *      sIdle is a "stutter step" which becomes longer each time the FSM falls
 *      back to sIdle, which it does if the process fails in sOpenSent or
 *      sOpenConfirm.
 *
 *      Cannot fail in sIdle !
 *
 *      In sConnect any failure causes the FSM to stop trying to connect.  It
 *      does nothing further until the end of the ConnectRetryTimer interval
 *      -- at which point it will try again, re-charging the timer.
 *      (That is usually 120 seconds (less jitter) -- so in the worst case, it
 *      will try to do something impossible every 90-120 seconds.)
 *
 *      RFC4271 ALERT:
 *
 *        The RFC specifies that if there is a TCP failure during Connect,
 *        then it proceeds to Active, and will wait a full ConnectRetryTime
 *        before reverting to Connect state, and attempting to open another
 *        connection.
 *
 *        This code waits until the end of the
 *
 *
 *      A connection may fall back to sIdle from sOpenSent/sOpenConfirm (see
 *      below).  While one connection is sOpenSent or sOpenConfirm we don't
 *      really want to start another TCP connection in competition.  So, on
 *      entry to sIdle:
 *
 *        * if a sibling exists and is in sOpenSent or sOpenConfirm:
 *
 *            - do not change the IdleHoldTimer interval.
 *            - unset the IdleHoldTimer.
 *            - set self "comatose".
 *
 *        * otherwise:
 *
 *            - increase the IdleHoldTimer interval.
 *            - set the IdleHoldTimer (with jitter).
 *
 *          and if a sibling exists and is comatose:
 *
 *            - set *its* IdleHoldTimer (with jitter).
 *            - clear *its* comatose flag.
 *
 *      The effect is that if both connections make it to sOpenSent, then only
 *      when *both* fall back to sIdle will the FSM try to make any new TCP
 *      connections.
 *
 *      The IdleHoldTimer increases up to 120 seconds.  In the worst case, the
 *      far end repeatedly makes outgoing connection attempts, and immediately
 *      drops them.  In which case, the IdleHoldTimer grows, and the disruption
 *      reduces to once every 90-120 seconds !
 *
 *   2) attempting to establish a BGP session: sOpenSent/sOpenConfirm
 *
 *      If something goes wrong, or the other end closes the connection (with
 *      or without notification) the FSM will loop back to sIdle state.  Also,
 *      when collision resolution closes one connection it too loops back to
 *      sIdle (see above).
 *
 *      Both connections may reach sOpenSent.  Only one at once can reach
 *      sOpenConfirm -- collision resolution sees to that.
 *
 *      Note that while a NOTIFICATION is being sent the connection stays
 *      in sOpenSent/sOpenConfirm state.
 *
 *   3) BGP session established
 *
 *      If something goes wrong, or the other end closes the connection
 *      (with or without notification) will stop the session.
 *
 * Only three things bring the FSM to a dead stop, and stop the session:
 *
 *   1) the Routeing Engine disabling the session.
 *
 *   2) invalid events -- which are assumed to be bugs, really.
 *
 *   3) anything that stops the session while in sEstablished state.
 *
 * This means that the FSM will plough on trying to establish connections with
 * configured peers, even in circumstances when the likelihood of success
 * appears slim to vanishing.  However, the Routeing Engine and the operator
 * are responsible for the decision to start and to stop trying to connect.

 * Finite State Machine States -- see also the RFC: RFC 4271
 *
 *   0. bgp_fsNULL  -- not an RFC state.
 *
 *      When a connection is initialised it is in bgp_fsNULL, and will then
 *      be pushed into bgp_fsIdle, with initial IdleHoldTimer running.
 *
 *   1. bgp_fsIdle
 *
 *      This code implements:  AllowAutomaticStart
 *                             DampPeerOscillations and IdleHoldTimer
 *
 *      This is not (quite) the RFC Idle state.  In the RFC "Idle" is a do
 *      nothing, wait for a start event state.  The RFC events are:
 *
 *         1. ManualStart
 *         4. ManualStart_with_Passive
 *
 *         3. AutomaticStart
 *         5. AutomaticStart_with_Passive
 *         6. AutomaticStart_with_Damp
 *         7. AutomaticStart_with_Damp_and_Passive
 *
 *        13. IdleHoldTimer_Expires
 *
 *      Where the RFC specifies a transition to Idle it is possible that some
 *      undefined mechanism will generate any of the AutomaticStart events.
 *
 *      In this code the functions of the RFC Idle state are divided into:
 *
 *        * fsNULL
 *
 *          which receives the ManualStart events... and moves to fsIdle
 *
 *        * fsIdle
 *
 *          This has two sub-states:
 *
 *            * not 'stopping'
 *
 *              where the FSM is waits on the IdleHoldTimer -- but see below
 *              for interaction with sending notifications and such like.
 *
 *              ie. RFC Idle after any of the AutomaticStart events.
 *
 *              can fall back to fsIdle from, for example fsOpenSent, and then
 *              start again trying to acquire a session.
 *
 *              If DampPeerOscillations is turned off, the IdleHoldTimer is set
 *              to a small value.
 *
 *            * 'stopping'
 *
 *               where the FSM is in RFC terms Idle, but no AutomaticStart is
 *               possible.
 *
 *               For the BGP Engine, once a session has reached Established
 *               state, any failure causes everything to stop, the BGP Engine
 *               cannot automatically require a session -- the Routeing
 *               Engine must adjust itself to the end of the session, and then
 *               it may restart the BGP Engine.
 *
 *          The handling of NOTIFICATION messages and such is pretty much the
 *          same for stopping and not stopping cases -- so we do not have a
 *          separate stoppin state.
 *
 *      The Passive and Damp properties are set while the FSM is in fsNULL
 *      state... so this code is not interested in the qualified Start events.
 *
 *      The RFC also mentions:
 *
 *         2. ManualStop
 *         8. AutomaticStop
 *
 *      Which are deemed to have no effect in Idle.  For the BGP Engine,
 *      stopping an FSM sends it to fsIdle + stopping state, and passes the
 *      session back to the Routeing Engine.
 *
 *      FWIW: the RFC should probably say that these events should stop any
 *            IdleHoldTimer
 *
 *      So, fsIdle is the RFC state *with* DampPeerOscillations, *while* is
 *      waiting for the IdleHoldTimer.  And fsNULL is, in essence, the
 *      rest of the RFC Idle state.
 *
 *      Now, fsIdle is a little more complicated that the above suggests:
 *
 *        * sending notification
 *
 *          when falls back to fsIdle a connection has come up, but has failed
 *          to reach fsEstablished.  Unless that was caused by an I/O failure,
 *          a notification message will have been sent.  We want that to have
 *          been written away before we leave fsIdle, or to at least have
 *          given a reasonable time for that to have happened.
 *
 *        * avoiding collisions
 *
 *          when coming out of fsIdle, if there is a sibling, which has
 *          reached fsOpenSent or fsOpenConfirm, the connection will hold back
 *          from going to fsConnect or fsActive for a short period, once.
 *
 *          In this case, if the other connection has reached fsOpenSent then
 *          at the least, when the other end sees the OPEN it will send OPEN
 *          (if not already sent) or NOTIFICATION.  If the other connection has
 *          has reached fsOpenConfirm then we have sent KEEPALIVE and we are
 *          waiting for a KEEPALIVE to signal all is well.  Unless there is
 *          an I/O failure, the process will soon reach fsEstablished, and
 *          there is no point starting a new alternative connection now.
 *
 *          If the other connection fails while this one is waiting, then it
 *          will go into fsIdle etc.  This connection will start up shortly.
 *
 *          If the other connection simply stops, then it will eventually time
 *          out, but this connection will start up in the meantime, no matter
 *          what.
 *
 *          If this is the inbound FSM, then if the other end has already
 *          initiated a connection, or does so while is in this IdleHoldTime
 *          extension, then this adds a short delay before considering that
 *          connection.  If the other end has decided against the other
 *          (inbound from its perspective) connection for some reason, then
 *          this is a (short) extra delay.  Note that the delay is small
 *          compared to the maximum IdleHoldTime
 *
 *   2. bgp_fsConnect
 *
 *      For the RFC the Connect state is where an FSM is waiting for an
 *      outbound ("active") or an inbound ("passive") connection.
 *
 *      The RFC is IMHO confused.  It speaks of "one FSM per connection"
 *      (8.2.1.2), but then goes on to describe the "BGP peer FSM" (8.2.2).
 *      So, in Connect state the FSM has to deal with both inbound and outbound
 *      connection events, and proceeds to OpenSent if either turn up.
 *
 *      On entry to Connect state an outgoing connection is initiated, and
 *      the ConnectRetryTimer is set:
 *
 *        * if the connection fails in some way (ie something happens but is
 *          unsuccessful) then the connection attempt is discarded, the
 *          ConnectRetryTimer is restarted and goes to Active.
 *
 *          In Active state, if the ConnectRetryTimer goes off, re-enters
 *          Connect state.
 *
 *        * if nothing happens, the connection attempt is discarded, and the
 *          FSM loops back and re-enters Connect.
 *
 *      Note that after a failure, it will be a full ConnectRetryTime before
 *      another attempt to connect is made.
 *
 *      This code runs a separate FSM for outbound and inbound connections.
 *      The fsConnect state is only used for outbound connections.
 *
 *      When a connection comes up:
 *
 *        * an OPEN is sent and goes to OpenSent -- unless DelayOpen is set.
 *
 *        * starts the DelayOpenTimer and enters a sub-state of Connect waiting
 *          for the timer or for an OPEN to be received -- at which point
 *          an OPEN is sent and goes to OpenSent.
 *
 *      This code does not (currently) implement DelayOpen.
 *
 *   3. bgp_fsActive
 *
 *      For the RFC the Active state is where an FSM is waiting for an
 *      inbound ("passive") connection *only*.  That is, there is no outbound
 *      ("active") connection in Active state -- so there.
 *
 *      This code runs a separate FSM for outbound and inbound connections.
 *      The fsActive state is only used for inbound ("passive") connections.
 *
 *      So... fsActive does not have to deal with ConnectRetryTimer, or
 *      anything else to do with outbound connections.  EXCEPT: the RFC
 *      description of a "PassiveTcpEstablishment" (8.1.1) says:
 *
 *        "This option indicates that the BGP FSM will passively wait
 *         for the remote BGP peer to establish the BGP TCP connection."
 *
 *      HOWEVER, the transition from Idle to Active sets the ConnectRetryTimer,
 *      and when that goes off, the FSM with start an outbound connection and
 *      change to Connect state.  SO, it looks as though passive connect may
 *      not be that passive... or the RFC fails to fully deal with the
 *      PassiveTcpEstablishment option.
 *
 *      This code TODO
 *
 *
 *
 *   4. bgp_fsOpenSent
 *
 *      Waiting for an OPEN message to roll up.  When it does, do any
 *      collision resolution and either proceed to send KEEPALIVE and change
 *      to OpenConfirm, or proceed to drop connection and change to fsIdle
 *      "comatose".
 *
 *      See...  for notes on collision resolution  TODO
 *
 *   5. bgp_fsOpenConfirm
 *
 *      Waiting for KEEPALIVE message to confirm all is well.
 *
 *      Only one connection for a session can reach fsOpenConfirm -- though
 *      that session can be dumped before it reaches fsEstablished.
 *
 *   6. bgp_fsEstablished
 *
 *      Processing UPDATEs etc.
 *
 *   7. bgp_fsStop
 *
 *      NB: in this state the FSM/Connection is no longer attached to the
 *          parent session.  As far as the BGP Engine and the Routeing Engine
 *          are concerned, the session is over.
 *
 *          The FSM/Connection lingers if a NOTIFICATION is pending being
 *          sent or may be received.

/*==============================================================================
 * The BGP connections timers handling.
 *
 * The FSM has five timers (though, apart from the KeepaliveTimer, they all
 * use the connection->hold fsm_timer):
 *
 *   * IdleHoldTimer -- uses session->args.holdtime_secs with jitter
 *                   -- uses connection->hold fsm_timer
 *
 *     This runs while in Idle state, and is a period in which no connections
 *     are started, and none will be accepted.
 *
 *     The purpose of this timer is to slow down re-making connections with
 *     peers who are flapping or otherwise proving a nuisance.
 *
 *     This is a one shot timer, which generates a bgp_fsm_eStart event.
 *
 *   * ConnectRetryTimer -- uses session->args.connect_retry_secs with jitter
 *                       -- uses connection->hold fsm_timer
 *
 *     This runs while in sConnect or sActive state, and is the period for which
 *     the connection is prepared to wait between attempts to connect.
 *
 *     When trying to make a connect connection:
 *
 *       The primary connection (if any) will be in sConnect state.
 *
 *       The secondary connection (if any) will be in sActive state.
 *
 *       If nothing happens before the ConnectRetryTimer expires, then
 *       the connection attempt will be abandoned, and another started.
 *
 *       If the connection attempt fails, closes any connect() socket, but then
 *       waits for the ConnectRetryTimer to expire.
 *
 *     The ConnectRetryTimer recharges itself (with new jitter each time).  It
 *     generates a bgp_fsm_eConnectRetry event.
 *
 *  * OpenHoldTimer  -- uses connection->cops->open_hold_secs *without* jitter
 *                   -- uses connection->hold fsm_timer
 *
 *    This timer is used in sOpenSent state, and limits the time will wait for
 *    an Open to appear from the other end.  RFC4271 calls for this to be a
 *    "large value" -- suggesting 240 seconds.
 *
 *    This is a one shot timer, which generates a bgp_fsm_eHoldTimer
 *    event.
 *
 *  * HoldTimer  -- uses session->args.holdtime_secs *without* jitter
 *               -- uses connection->hold fsm_timer
 *
 *    This timer is used in sOpenConfirm and sEstablished states only.
 *
 *    This timer is also used in sOpenConfirm and sEstablished states, and
 *    limits the time the connection will be held if hear nothing from the
 *    other end.  In these states the timer is set to the negotiated HoldTime.
 *    If this is zero, then the HoldTime is infinite.
 *
 *    This timer is recharged every time some input arrives, and generates a
 *    bgp_fsm_eHoldTimer event (and stops) if it ever goes off.
 *
 *  * KeepaliveTimer -- uses session->args.keepalive_secs with jitter.
 *                   -- uses connection->keepalive fsm_timer
 *
 *    This timer is used in sOpenConfirm and sEstablished states only.
 *
 *    The default KeepalineTimer is 1/3 the HoldTimer, and is set from the
 *    negotiated HoldTime.  If that is zero, then the KeepaliveTime is also
 *    zero and treated as infinite, and no KEEPALIVE messages will be sent
 *    (other than the "ack" of the OPEN message).
 *
 *    This timer is recharged each time it goes off, and generates a
 *    bgp_fsm_eKeepaliveTimer event.

       * effectively, in milliseconds.  What we actually set is:
       *
       *   ft->jitter_unit = (interval / (100 * js)) | 1
       *
       * Which has two effects: (a) it ensures that when the random jitter
       * is multiplied by the unit, the ls bits of the result are affected
       * by the jitter, and (b) if the interval is stupidly small, there
       * is some jitter !  What (a) does is round up, except where the
       * interval is an exact multiple of milliseconds (which it usually
       * is) in which case it adds 1.
       *
       * Suppose an interval of 1 second, and a jitter of 25%:
       *
       *   ft->interval    = ((1,000,000,000 * (100 - 25) + 99) / 100
       *                   = 750,000,000 nano-seconds
       *
       *   ft->jitter      = 25 * js = 250,000
       *
       *   ft->jitter_unit = (1,000,000,000 / (100 * js)) | 1
       *                   = 1,001 ;
       *
       * If qrand(ft->jitter) comes up zero, we get ft->interval.
       *
       * If qrand(ft->jitter) comes up maximum we get:
       *
       *   ft->interval + (249,999 * 1,001) = 1.000_248_999 seconds
       *
       * Which is a touch over the nominal maximum.  For a 90 second
       * interval the maximum is 90.000_159_999 seconds.
       *
       * Now, if the ft->interval is less than the given interval_min, it is
       * set to that interval_min.
       *
       * NB: if ft->interval < interval_min, then the jittered interval may
       *     be much greater than the nominal interval.
       *
       *     If interval = interval_min = 1.000_000_000 second and the
       *     jitter is 25%, then the maximum jittered interval is:
       *
       *       1.250_248_999 seconds.
       *
       *     If interval = 1.333_333_334 and interval_min = 1.000_000_000
       *     and the jitter is 25%, then the minimum jittered interval is
       *     1.000_000_001 (so interval_min is moot).
       *
       * NB: the interval can be 1,001 *days* and not overflow the arithmetic.
