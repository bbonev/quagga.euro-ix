/*==============================================================================
 * Each peer_rib has a rib_main adj-in and an optional rib_rs adj-in.
 *
 * The adj-in is an ihash table, by prefix_id.  Each entry in the table points
 * to a route_info object.
 *
 * All routes received from the peer are held in the rib_main adj-in, even if
 * the route is filtered out.  (So is always capable of "soft reconfig".)
 *
 * As routes arrive from the I/O (ring-buffer), the adj-in's pending state
 * is updated, and the route-info is added to the list of those to be
 * processed for the neighbor.  At this moment, the need for information
 * about the next-hop is registered.
 *
 * If the route has not been filtered out, it is known to the respective
 * rib-node, and has an entry in its 'avail' svec.
 *
 * For each route-context the adj-in has its own attributes and merit, which
 * comprise the 'iroute'.  The iroutes for a route-context are hung from the
 * rib-node's 'rroute' for that route-context -- ith the current selection
 * as the first entry.

 * Pre-process candidates to deal with any Deterministic-MED.

 * excluding the MEDs.  Suppose those are:
 *
 *    a) NeighborAS=9, MED=X, Peer Type=eBGP, IGP Metric=4
 *    b) NeighborAS=1, MED=2, Peer Type=eBGP, IGP Metric=5
 *    c) NeighborAS=1, MED=5, Peer Type=eBGP, IGP Metric=3
 *
 * The MEDs say that (b) is better than (c), so we should not select (c).
 * However, if the best path selection starts with (a) and compares that with
 * (b), then (b) is eliminated.  The (a) will be compared with (c), and (c)
 * will be chosen !
 *
 * So... for "Deterministic MEDs" need to choose the best among those routes
 * with the same NeighborAS, and then compare those.
 *
 * Here we scan the candidates, looking for any with the same med-as, and
 * doing an immediate tie-break between them, then do tie-break between the
 * best in each cluster.
 *
 * The candidates with the same med-as are clustered together, in their
 * original order.  It is conceivable that at some point the candidates could
 * be permanently clustered... hence the logic here.
 *
 * NB: does nothing at all if there are 2 or fewer candidates.  With 2
 *     candidates the tie break will do meds as required !
 *
 * NB: the caller needs to worry about the possibility that the first route(s)
 *     on the list is(are) eliminated.
