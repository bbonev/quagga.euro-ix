/*==============================================================================
 * Each Global Route Context (rcontext) has a name and an rc-id.
 *
 * The rc-id is a small, non-zero, integer, allocated when the rcontext is
 * created.
 *
 * The name is local to the enclosing bgp view (instance) -- so a given "global"
 * route-context is only actually used within a single view.
 *
 * The theory is that each bgp view is quite distinct, so is likely to have
 * distinct route-contexts.  Even where one view shares some contexts with
 * another, it is possible that the inter-context IGP may be different, or
 * some other properties are different.  The south-side may map the rc-id used
 * by different views to the same thing as necessary.
 */

/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The rcontext.
 *
 * The rcontext maps the rc-id and the view/name to a table of lcontexts.
 *
 * An rcontext may be associated with the bgp view itself, or with one or
 * more peers within the view:
 *
 *   * for standard bgpd -- if there is no rcontext associated with the
 *     view, there is no IGP, and no means to install routes !
 *
 *     Only the unnamed view can have an rcontext associated with it.
 *
 *   * for SDN bgpd, one or more peers may be associated with an rcontext,
 *     but that may not be the same as the 'view' (if it has an rcontext).
 *
 *   * for route-server -- each route-server-client or rsc-group has its own
 *                         rcontext.
