 * Note that adj_out and rf->current are NULL for withdrawn (or never announced)
 * for ordinary and MPLS prefixes.
 *
 * In steady-state, the adj_out points at the attr_set, and owns a lock.  Or
 * points at the route_mpls, which points at the attr_set, and owns a lock.
 * Note that in steady state the route_mpls atp pointer is never NULL.
 *
 * When a route_flux is created, the adj_out attributes or route_mpls pointer
 * is copied to 'current', retaining the lock, to be replaced by the pointer
 * to the route_flux.
 *
 * When there is a new pending update, the 'pending' pointer points at an
 * attr_set, and owns a lock.  Or points at a route_mpls, which points at the
 * attr_set and owns a lock.
 *
 * When marshalling updates for the same attributes together, an attr_flux
 * object is created.  The pointer to the attributes moves from 'pending'
 * or 'atp', into the route_flux.  NB: 'pending' or 'atp' *retain* their
 *
 *
 * Note that where we have a pending withdraw we may have:
 *
 *   a) rf->pending -> NULL                -- there is nothing else
 *
 *   b) rf->pending -> route_mpls -> NULL  -- there is nothing else
 *
 *      This is the case when an announce was pending, but has been followed
 *      by a withdraw -- we keep the route_mpls in case something else changes.
 *
 *   c) rf->pending -> attr_set            -- there is an announce pending
 *               or -> route_mpls -> attr_set
 *
 *      In this case there is an announce pending after the withdraw is output.
 *      (This can happen once a withdraw has been dispatched.)
 *
 * The fifo_batch, withdraw_queue and fifo_mrai queues are queues of
 * route_flux objects.
 *
 * The announce_queue queue is a queue of attr_flux objects.  Each attr_flux
 * object has a queue of route_flux objects.
 *
 * The adj_out owns a lock on the current attr_set (if any) -- which it points
 * to either directly or via a route_flux and/or route_mpls.
 *
 * The rf->pending owns a lock on the pending attr_set (if any) -- which it
 * points to either directly or via a route_mpls and/or attr_flux.   Note that
 * the attr_flux does *not* have a lock.
 *
 * This means that when a route_flux object is created, the then adj_out
 * pointer can simply be moved to rf->current.  Similarly, when an update is
 * sent, rf->pending can be moved to rf->current, and when the route_flux is
 * discarded, rf->current becomes the adj_out pointer.

/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Update or set the adj_out for the given peer in the given node.
 *
 * For whatever reason, we have a new route for the given prefix, for the given
 * peer -- having completed any 'out' route-map etc.
 *
 * Schedules an update if required -- implementing MinRouteAdvertisementTimer
 * (MRAI).
 *
 * RFC4271 (9.2.1.1) specifies MinRouteAdvertisementTimer "per-destination"
 * and "per BGP peer", but goes on to weaken that to make implementation
 * easier.  The RFC does not distinguish between withdraw updates and announce
 * updates, but there is research which suggests that *not* delaying Withdraw
 * is a Good Idea.
 *
 * Applying MRAI to withdraws is generally known as WRATE, and not doing so is
 * NO-WRATE.  Quagga has, historically, implemented NO-WRATE.
 *
 * This Quagga implements "per-destination" MRAI.  It also implements a
 * batching system, which batches changes together, and absorbs very rapid
 * changes in a prefix.  There is then a further delay for announcements, to
 * aggregate those which use the same attributes.  Once an update for a given
 * prefix has been sent to a given peer, Quagga delays any further change for
 * the MRAI time less the batch-time, except where the prefix is withdrawn
 * within that time.
 *
 * The batching introduces a delay starting at the moment a prefix first
 * changes to the time that prefix is dispatched, in a batch with other
 * contemporary changes.  This is similar to the Juniper "out-delay" parameter.
 * The handling of MRAI is integrated with this batching mechanism.
 *
 * When a prefix has been unchanged for at least MRAI since the last update was
 * sent (if any), the prefix is in "steady state".  When a new update arrives
 * for a state prefix, this Quagga will:
 *
 *   * ignore updates which do not change the current state of the prefix.
 *
 *   * for withdraw: apply batch-delay (1.5 sec for iBGP & cBGP, 3 sec for eBGP)
 *     delay, then send the withdraw as quickly as I/O will allow.
 *
 *     This is a change from previous Quagga behaviour, where withdraws would
 *     be sent as soon as I/O delays would allow.
 *
 *     If an announce arrives, the pending change is updated and rescheduled.
 *     If the announce would restore the original attributes, the prefix
 *     reverts to steady state.
 *
 *   * for announce: apply the same batch-delay, then send the update after
 *     at most the aggregation-delay (1 sec for iBGP & cBGP, 2 sec for eBGP),
 *     plus any I/O delays.  The batching produces bursts of announcements,
 *     ~0.536 wide -- so any announcements with the same attributes in that
 *     burst will be aggregated.  The further aggregation-delay spreads the
 *     opportunity a little wider.
 *
 *     If an announce or withdraw arrives which restores the original state,
 *     the prefix reverts to steady state.
 *
 *     If a further announce or withdraw arrives, it is rescheduled.
 *
 *     This is also a change from previous Quagga behaviour, where the
 *     announcement process starts at MRAI after the start of the previous
 *     run, and outputs updates for all routes with uptimes of less than
 *     the start of the current run -- subject to I/O delays.  This means
 *     that from uptime to output is between 0 and MRAI -- so, on average,
 *     MRAI / 2, plus I/O delays.
 *
 *     For this Quagga, for iBGP batch-delay + aggregation-delay is 2.5 secs,
 *     which is MRAI/2 !  But for eBGP it is 5 secs, which is rather faster
 *     than 15 seconds.  In both cases the delay is more predictable, and the
 *     I/O delays are the same.
 *
 *     Note that there is some analysis which suggests that an MRAI of 30
 *     seconds is too long for eBGP and that 15 or less would be a reasonable
 *     alternative.
 *
 *   * Note that each further change causes the batch-delay to be restarted,
 *     until the total delay reaches MRAI + batch-delay, at which point the
 *     current state is dispatched, whatever it is.
 *
 *     This is consistent with the RFC, which requires a "constant upper bound"
 *     on the MRAI -- in this case MRAI * 2 (plus I/O delays).
 *
 * At this point, the two times associated with a scheduled item can be
 * described:
 *
 *   * schedule-time -- this is held in 0.268 second units, in 10 bits.
 *
 *     This uses the pfifo item index and the pfifo to manage the schedule
 *     time for items in the body of the pfifo.  Any item which has fallen
 *     out of the pfifo is deemed to have a schedule time of ????  TODO
 *
 *   * delta-time -- held in 0.268 second units, in 9 bits.
 *
 *     Adding this to the schedule-time gives the dead-line for items on the
 *     batch queue.
 *
 * The schedule-time and the next processing time work in 0.268 second
 * "periods".  The schedule-time is rounded up to the next period.  The next
 * processing time is the start of the first period with something in it.  When
 * the queue is processed, the current period and the next period are emptied.
 * This means that items are processed at most 0.268 seconds behind their true
 * schedule-time and at most 0.268 seconds ahead of it.  Consider four
 * schedule-times a, b, c and d which are:
 *
 *      p-n      p        p+1      p+2      p+3
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |        |a      b|c      d|        |        |
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *
 * that is, they are at the start and end of two consecutive periods.  They are
 * rounded up to be placed as A, B, C and D:
 *
 *      p        p+1      p+2      p+3
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *      |a      b|c      d|        |        |        |
 *      |        |AB      |CD      |        |        |
 *      +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *
 * Assuming nothing else is going on, the next processing time will be p+1,
 * at which point all of A, B, C & D will be processed.  Clearly b & c are
 * processed pretty much at the intended time.  While a is processed nearly
 * 0.268 seconds late, and d is processed nearly 0.268 secs early.
 *
 * The batch size is ~0.536 secs wide.  After processing, the next processing
 * time will be p+3 or later.  [To be precise, therefore, the batch-delay is
 * 1.608 secs +/- 0.268.  Note that for the batching to work, batch-delay must
 * be at least 0.268... otherwise when the time is p+1 the next processing run
 * can start, and c and d may not have been scheduled yet !]
 *
 * When an update is dispatched it is placed on one of two queues:
 *
 *   a) withdraw queue.
 *
 *      this is emptied by the I/O process, just as quickly as is possible.
 *
 *      Once an update reaches the withdraw queue, its fate is sealed.  If an
 *      announce rolls up, it is set pending -- unless that restores the
 *      original attribute state, in which case the prefix reverts to the
 *      steady state.  When the withdraw is actually output, any pending
 *      announce will sit in MRAI state.
 *
 *   b) announce queue
 *
 *      here we wish to aggregate updates which use the same attributes, for
 *      which there is a secondary scheduling process, based on the attributes.
 *
 *      The announce queue is populated by 'attr_flux' objects.  Each one has
 *      one or more prefixes attached to it, and those will appear together
 *      in an update message, if at all possible.  Each 'attr_flux' has a
 *      schedule-time, which is handled in the same way as for the batch
 *      queue.
 *
 *        aggregation-delay = ~1 sec for iBGP, cBGP
 *                            ~2 sec for eBGP
 *
 *      When the first route_flush with a given set of attributes is dispatched,
 *      an attr_flux object is created, and it is added to the announce queue,
 *      with a new schedule-time.
 *
 *      If a further route_flux with the same set of attributes is dispatched,
 *      it is added to the attr_flux, effectively inheriting the attr_flux's
 *      schedule-time.  So, having the same attributes as an earlier route_flux
 *      can accelerate, but not further delay, output.
 *
 * Now we get the fiddly cases, where the attributes for a route_flux change
 * once it is in the announce queue.  This is not something we expect,
 * particularly, but need to do something sensible in these cases:
 *
 *    * if the result is the original state, the prefix returns to steady
 *      state (!)
 *
 *    * if this is a withdraw, then the route_flux is moved to the withdraw
 *      queue -- and from that moment its fate is sealed, as above.
 *
 *    * if this is an announce for a set of attributes not in use already,
 *      creates a new attr_flux and queue it according to the current
 *      attr_flux's schedule-time.
 *
 *      So, further announcements cannot delay the output of an update for
 *      a prefix.
 *
 *    * if this is an announce for a set of attributes which are already
 *      queued, then:
 *
 *          i) if the schedule-time for that attr_flux is less than the
 *             schedule-time for the current attr_flux, then the route_flux
 *             inherits that shorter schedule.
 *
 *         ii) if the schedule-time for that attr_flux is greater than the
 *             schedule-time for the  current attr_flux, then the attr_flux's
 *             schedule-time is reduced.
 *
 *      Note that the schedule-time for an attr_flux can only go down.  The
 *      schedule-time for each route_flux is effectively the schedule-time for
 *      the attr_flux it is currently attached to, and may only go down if
 *      the attributes change.
 *
 *      If the previous attr_flux no longer has any associated prefixes, it is
 *      de-queued.
 *
 * When an update is sent, the prefix enters a cooling-off period -- the MRAI.
 * During MRAI a route_flux object sits on the batch queue, with a schedule-
 * time of the update time + MRAI - batch-delay, marked aob_mrai.  At the end
 * of the MRAI, the prefix will return to steady state, unless a change is
 * pending, in which case it will be re-queued with the batch-delay.  Note that
 * prefixes which have been withdrawn may already have a pending announce
 * attached to them when they enter MRAI.
 *
 * If a change arrives while awaiting MRAI:
 *
 *   * withdraw changes are rescheduled, for dispatch after batch-delay.
 *
 *     Ignored if the current state is withdrawn.
 *
 *     This is NO-WRATE in action.
 *
 *     The route_flux remains aob_mrai -- so if an announce arrives before the
 *     end of the batch-delay, it can be rescheduled as MRAI again.
 *
 *   * announce changes are stored up to the end of the MRAI period, including
 *     reverting to the current state.
 *
 *     If there is a pending withdraw, resets the schedule-time to the MRAI
 *     schedule.
 *
 * When the MRAI schedule time expires, the prefix either falls into steady
 * state, or is rescheduled for dispatch after batch-delay.
 *
 * Note that in MRAI state waits for the MRAI less the batch-delay, so that the
 * batch-delay overlays the tail end of MRAI.

/*==============================================================================
 * MRAI pfifo handling.
 *
 * After sending an update for a given prefix it enters rf_act_mrai state,
 * where the prefix waits for MRAI - batch_delay, before falling back to
 * steady state.  Note that does not wait for the full MRAI, so that if a
 * change rolls up immediately after returning to steady state, the batch_delay
 * it will then experience overlaps the end of the full MRAI.
 *
 * If the full MRAI is less than the batch_delay, then there is no MRAI pfifo,
 * and after sending an update the prefix immediately falls back to steady
 * state.
 *
 * So, on entry to MRAI we have:
 *
 *   (1)   |<------- Full MRAI -------->|
 *         |<--- MRAI - BD --->|<- BD ->|           (BD == batch-delay)
 *         *-------------------*--------*
 *         ^                   ^        ^
 *         |                   |        dead-line
 *         |                   schedule-time for return to steady state
 *         |                   MRAI-End
 *         update-time
 *
 * The route_flux has a NULL pending change, and aob_mrai_wait is set to
 * indicate that there is no change pending.
 *
 * Now, suppose a withdraw rolls up.  We want to do the NO-WRATE stuff... so
 * reschedule to the current time plus batch-delay so that, if the withdraw is
 * well before the MRAI-End, we have:
 *
 *   (2a)  |<---------- MRAI ---------->|
 *         |<--- MRAI - BD --->|<- BD ->|
 *         *----w--------+-----*--------*
 *         ^    ^<- BD ->^              ^
 *         |    |        |              dead-line
 *         |    |        schedule-time for withdraw
 *         |    withdraw
 *         update-time
 *
 * So that if nothing else happens, the withdraw can be dispatched after the
 * usual batch-delay.  But if something else does happen, the MRAI-End can be
 * be recovered from the dead-line.  While the withdraw is pending, is not
 * aob_mrai_wait.
 *
 * If a withdraw rolls up at any time up to but excluding MRAI-End, we have:
 *
 *   (2b)  |<---------- MRAI ---------->|
 *         |<--- MRAI - BD --->|<- BD ->|
 *         *---------------w---*----+---*
 *         ^               ^<- BD ->^   ^
 *         |               |        |   dead-line
 *         |               |        schedule-time for withdraw
 *         |               withdraw
 *         update-time
 *
 * There's actually no difference between (2a) and (2b).
 *
 * If the withdraw arrives at or after MRAI-End, then the prefix can be
 * rescheduled as rf_act_batch -- as if it had fallen back to steady state,
 * before the withdraw turned up.
 *
 * Now, suppose an announce rolls up.  We want the full MRAI to expire before
 * any announce, so we reschedule to the full MRAI.  So, if the announce is
 * any time up to but excluding MRAI-End, we have:
 *
 *   (3)   |<---------- MRAI ---------->|
 *         |<--- MRAI - BD --->|<- BD ->|
 *         *----a--------------*--------*
 *         ^    ^                       ^
 *         |    |                       dead-line
 *         |    |                       schedule-time for announce
 *         |    announce
 *         update-time
 *
 * Note that if enters MRAI after a withdraw is output, there may be an
 * announce pending, and in that case, starts in state (3).
 *
 * So now we have withdraw, announce or revert (return to current state) while
 * in state (2) or state (3):
 *
 *   2w: withdraw while withdraw pending -- no effect
 *
 *   2a: announce while withdraw pending.
 *
 *       If before MRAI-End, change to state (3).
 *
 *       If at or after MRAI-End, reschedule as rf_act_batch.
 *
 *   2r: revert while withdraw pending.
 *   3r: revert while announce pending
 *
 *       If before MRAI-End, reverts to state (1).
 *
 *       If at or after MRAI-End, fall back to steady state.
 *
 *   3w: withdraw while announce pending
 *
 *       If before MRAI-End, change to state (2).
 *
 *       If at or after MRAI-End, reschedule as rf_act_batch.
 *
 *   3a: announce while announce pending
 *
 *       Ignore if no change of announcement.
 *
 *       If before MRAI-End, update, but stay in state (3).
 *
 *       If at or after MRAI-End, reschedule as rf_act_batch.
 *
 * So... if the prefix bounces around before MRAI-End, it stays on the
 * fifo_mrai and the earliest it can be dispatched is after the full MRAI,
 * unless is withdrawn.  If change after MRAI-End, it will be scheduled
 * as rf_act_batch -- as if had gone to steady state before the change.
