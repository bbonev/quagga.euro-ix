 * The RIB, the Peer-RIBs, Route-Contexts, RIB_Walkers etc.
 *
 * For each bgp instance (view), for each AFI/SAFI, there will be a bgp_rib,
 * aka the RIB -- if there are any neighbors in that view which are configured
 * for that AFI/SAFI.  Each prefix in the RIB has a "rib-node", in an ihash by
 * prefix_id.
 *
 * For each peer, for each AFI/SAFI, there will be a peer_rib.  The peer-rib
 * contains (inter alia) the adj-in and adj-out for the peer.  The adj-in
 * the adj-in is an ihash by prefix-id of "route-info" objects, comprising the
 * routes received from that peer.  The adj-out is also an ihash by prefix-id,
 * comprising all routes announced to that peer.
 *
 * For each route-context, for each AFI/SAFI, there will be a bgp_rcontext.
 * The route-context has some incoming filters associated with it.  Each
 * route-context has a global-id -- by which it is known to the next-hop and
 * in particular to the next-hop metric stuff.  Within a given RIB there is
 * a local-id (the local-context) -- so that the tables of things by context
 * in the rib-node and the route-info can be as dense as possible.
 *
 * Each route-info has a table, by local-context of "iroute"s, which contain
 * the attributes and merit for each route available from the peer in that
 * context.  Each rib-node has a table of lists, by local-context, of the
 * available iroutes, in that context, from all peers -- the first iroute on
 * the list is the current selection.

 *      Serendipity has left value 3 unused.

 *      For Local Routes this field is set to 0 (unused origin).

 * local preference, ordinary route, maximum AS-PATH, *unused* origin type).

   * However, a full sort could be expensive, and generally routes are stable,

   *
   *   * the current selection first
   *
   *   * other routes, possibly completely unsorted.

   * We have an UNSORTED flag for each route, and we have the rule that:

   * This means that when finding all routes with the greatest merit, the scan
   * can stop as soon as it finds a sorted route of less merit.
