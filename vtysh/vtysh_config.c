/*==============================================================================
 * Configuration store.
 *
 * Configuration files are generated by calling the "config_write" function
 * in each node that has one, in node number order.
 *
 * The nodes which have a "config write" are known as "configuration nodes".
 *
 * The integrated configuration file is built by reading configurations
 * generated by all the connected daemons, and merging where possible.
 *
 * The "#daemon" meta-command allows the integrated configuration to contain
 * commands which are only be used by the respective daemons.  This allows:
 *
 *   a) the integrated configuration file can be read directly by any
 *      daemon -- it does not need to be filtered by the vtysh.
 *
 *   b) common items, such as route-maps, do not need to be identical for
 *      all daemons.
 *
 *   c) when creating an integrated configuration file, each daemon's
 *      configuration is unaffected by any other daemons'.
 *
 * The creation of the integrated configuration file is, essentially a merge
 * of all the daemons' individual configurations.  The structure of the
 * configuration as output by each daemon is key to the merge and its
 * output:
 *
 *   a) each configuration "node" is separate.
 *
 *      The node is the top level configuration item.  A node may contain
 *      line, group and section items.  A group or section may contain further
 *      line, group and section items.
 *
 *      Any merging of configuration does not cross node/section/group
 *      boundaries, but will merge like node/section/group together, if
 *      possible.
 *
 *      The #vtysh-config-node, #vty-config-section and #vtysh-config-group
 *      meta-commands mark those boundaries.
 *
 *      Each group/section has a content_type, which may specify a "parser".
 *      If there is a parser, it examines each command line, and may identify
 *      a (possibly nested) implicit group/section structure -- in addition
 *      to any explicit structure.
 *
 *   b) the configuration is output in node number order.
 *
 *      There is an implied "NULL_NODE" at the start of the configuration,
 *      which carries ..... XXX .......................................................
 *
 *   c) the #vty-config-section and #vtysh-config-group meta-commands
 *      take two forms:
 *
 *        1. #vtysh-config-section 99 <content-type> <name...>
 *           #vtysh-config-group   99 <content-type> <name...>
 *
 *           where: 99 is the depth of the group/section -- 1..
 *
 *                  <content-type> is one of the vct_xxxx (other than vct_end)
 *
 *                  <name...>      is the name of the group/section
 *
 *           The enclosing node is implicitly depth == 0.
 *
 *           The depth must be 1..n, where n is <= current depth + 1.
 *
 *           These commands either create or re-enter the named section/group,
 *           see below.
 *
 *        2. #vtysh-config-section 99 end
 *           #vtysh-config-group   99 end
 *
 *           The depth must be 1..n, where n is <= current depth.
 *
 *           These commands end the given depth of group/section, returning to
 *           the parent group/section/node.
 *
 *   d) A section is a self contained piece of configuration, which has limited
 *      dependency on the rest of the node's configuration.
 *
 *      All command lines and groups in a given section are merged, and for
 *      some content types, sorted.  The result is a single section.
 *
 *      All sections are collected at the end of their parent node/section/
 *      group, sorted into section name order.
 *
 *      The simplest model is for all sections to be independent of each other,
 *      and any section may depend on other configuration in the parent -- but
 *      not vice versa.  However, dependency between sections may be controlled
 *      by manipulating the section name.
 *
 *   e) A group is also a self contained piece of configuration, which is
 *      required to retain its order wrt other groups and command lines,
 *      for each daemon.
 *
 *
 *   f) group and line items in a node/section/group either merge or sort.
 *
 *      Generally, the lines/groups in a group/section/node are "merged".
 *      The merging uses the "name" of the line/group.  For a line the "name"
 *      is the complete line.  For a group, the "name" is the group name.
 *      Lines and groups have separate name spaces.  Where two lines have the
 *      same name they will be merged provided that:
 *
 *         * the order of lines/groups for each daemon is preserved.
 *
 *         * repeated lines for a given daemon are retained.
 *
 *      Where two groups have the same name, they will be merged provided:
 *
 *         * the order of lines/groups for each daemon is preserved.
 *
 *      If the content type specifies it, the lines/groups in a group/section
 *      may be sorted, using the keys provided by the content type parser.
 *      Equal lines (by name, not by key) are merged, but if a given line
 *      repeats for some daemon, it will continue to repeat.  Equal groups
 *      (by name, not by key) will merge.  When the group/section is sorted,
 *      equal keys will sort into the original order.
 *
 *      In all cases, sections in a node/section/group are sorted wrt to each
 *      other, and sorted to the end of the parent node/section/group.
 *
 *      The basic merge will take:
 *
 *          daemon 1:
 *             item a
 *             item e
 *             item k
 *
 *          daemon 2:
 *             item b
 *             item d
 *             item b
 *             item k
 *
 *          daemon 3:
 *             item b
 *             item c
 *             item f
 *
 *      and produce:
 *
 *             item a  (1)
 *             item e  (1)
 *             item b  (2, 3)
 *             item d  (2)
 *             item b  (2)
 *             item c  (3)
 *             item k  (1, 2)
 *             item f  (3)
 *
 *      but if this is sorted, that will produce:
 *
 *             item a  (1)
 *             item b  (2, 3)
 *             item b  (2)
 *             item c  (3)
 *             item d  (2)
 *             item e  (1)
 *             item f  (3)
 *             item k  (1, 2)
 *
 *      NOTE: when each daemon outputs its configuration it does so in a
 *      fixed order.  This is KEY -- when merging nodes which contain
 *      configuration from two or more daemons, the lines and groups appear
 *      in the *same* order.  So any common parts can be found and merged
 *      *without* having to worry about whether the order is significant or
 *      not.
 *
 *      A sorted content type does not improve the ability to merge, but does
 *      improve the appearance of the result where there is a well known
 *      order.
 *
 * XXX ..................................................................................
 *
 *   d) the configuration may contain comments and separator lines.
 *
 *      A comment is a line whose first non-whitespace character is '!' or
 *      '#', and contains at least one non-whitespace character.
 *
 *      A separator line is one which contains only whitespace, or '!' or
 *      '#' and only whitespace.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *      Comments are attached to the command line or group which they precede.
 *      Separators following a comment line are attached to the comment line.
 *
 *      Separators are attached to the command line, command group or comment
 *      line which they follow.  Multiple separators are merged together, and
 *      '#' takes precedence over '!' which takes precedence over empty.
 *
 *      When deciding whether to merge two command lines or groups, comment
 *      and whitespace is ignored.  When merging, any attached comments and/or
 *      separators are also merged.
 *
 *      When merging comments TODO......................................................
 *
 * XXX .................................................................................
 *
 *   e) At the start of each configuration is the "NULL" node, and at the end
 *      of each node is the NULL line.
 *
 *      Any comments at the end of a node are attached to a NULL line at the
 *      end of the node.  So any comments preceding the first node are attached
 *      to a NULL line at the end of the NULL node.
 *
 *      Any separators immediately following the start of a node are treated as
 *      separators following a phantom comment line.
 *
 *
 * XXX ..................................................................................
 *
 * When generating an integrated configuration, each attached daemon is asked
 * for its current configuration.  The first line of the configuration returned
 * by each daemon MUST be:
 *
 *    #vtysh-config-daemon DAEMON-NAME
 *
 * for the avoidance of doubt, and so that the configurations returned by all
 * daemons can be concatenated and then processed.
