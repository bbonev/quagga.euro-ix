/*==============================================================================
 * Line control handles the output of simple text to a telnet connection,
 * folding and counting lines (for "--more--" purposes) if required.
 *
 * LIMITATIONS:
 *
 *   1) does not handle '\r' except as part of '\r''\n' pairs.
 *
 *      Telnet requires that bare '\r' be sent as '\r''\0'.  That is not
 *      implemented.
 *
 *      The handling of '\r' which is not part of '\r''\n' is UNDEFINED.
 *      (In particular, the '\r' may be sent as is, or not sent at all.)
 *
 *   2) does not worry about '\t' or '\b' or any other control character.
 *
 *      Apart from '\r' and '\n' all characters are deemed to be printing
 *      characters -- and to have width == 1.
 *
 *   3) has no idea about escape sequences or telnet commands.
 *
 *      In particular: when looking for '\n' (and '\r') has no way of telling
 *      if those are part of an escape sequence.
 *
 *   4) DOES NOT handle 0xFF character value.
 *
 *      For Telnet this should be escaped.  It isn't.
 *
 * Current use of VTY command output will not be troubled by these limitations.
 * To do more would cost code and cpu unnecessarily.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES DO:
 *
 *   1) maps bare '\n' to '\r''\n' -- if required.
 *
 *      Swallows '\r' immediately before '\n' if present.
 *
 *   2) if required, breaks output into screen width chunks, and counts
 *      down the height of a "screen full".
