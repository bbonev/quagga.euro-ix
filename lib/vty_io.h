   *                return code picked up, the vf can be closed.

   *                This interacts with vf_cancel -- see below.

   *                    input to a stop.
   *
   *                  - when an input is popped/closed.
   *
   *   for output:  output continues, and in cases where generally output is
   *                done in "chunks", vf_cease forces buffers to be emptied.
   *
   *                vf_cease is set by almost all vx_xxx exceptions.
   *
   *                vf_cease is also set when an output is popped/closed.
   *

   *                But when all buffers are empty, iff vf_cease is set will
   *                then clear vf_end.

   *
   *                for all inputs vf_cancel with vf_cease means that vf_end
   *                should be set, all buffered input should be discarded,
   *                and all further input any child process return code

   *                usually set at the same time, and hence vf_end also.
   *
   *   for output:  vf_cancel means stop outputting -- at least for general
   *                output: log monitor output may continue.
   *
   *                On its own this does *not* mean close.  If vf_cancel and

   *                When the dust settles, the hiatus will clear vf_cancel and

 *
 * The vout_depth reflects the vin_depth at which the vout was opened, and
 * will be:
 *
 *   * vout_depth == vin_depth + 1

 *
 *  * vout_depth < vin_depth
 *
 *    This is true when one or vins have been opened and are stacked on top
 *    of each other.  As the vins are closed, the vin_depth reduces until
 *    it hits the vout_depth, as above.
 *
 * When a vout is opened, the then current vout_depth is stored in the
 * vf->depth_mark, and restored from there when the vout is closed.
 *
 * The vin_depth drives the closing of vouts.  The state of the top vin drives
