/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The struct qpt_thread_attr captures the attributes of the underlying
 * pthread.
 *
 * Some attributes are set when the pthread is created, and some may be set
 * both then and changed thereafter.  For the main (or only) pthread the
 * attributes which cannot be set after pthread creation are (implicitly)
 * unchangeable.
 *
 * The attributes we know about are:
 *
 *   * scope                   -- process/system at creation time *only*.
 *
 *     aka contention scope.  Two are specified: process and system scopes.
 *
 *     POSIX is vague in this area.  It specifies that if a process contains
 *     both process and system scope pthreads, the interaction between them is
 *     unspecified.  POSIX does not specify what the scope of the main pthread
 *     is (AFAICS) -- though if all other pthreads have the same scope the main
 *     pthread is assumed to follow suit.  A system may support one or both of
 *     process and system.
 *
 *     The system default is implementation defined.
 *
 *     FreeBSD and Linux, for example, only support system scope, which
 *     simplifies things.
 *
 *     Generally one would prefer system scope, and that is the default here.
 *
 *   * scheduling policy and parameters   -- settable at any time
 *
 *     POSIX is wonderfully vague in this area, and most things are
 *     implementation defined.
 *
 *     There are four known policies:
 *
 *       SCHED_FIFO
 *       SCHED_RR       -- these are preemptive and the same as each other,
 *                         except that in SCHED_RR a running pthread may be
 *                         preempted by another at the same priority after some
 *                         time period.
 *
 *                         The only known parameter is a priority.
 *
 *       SCHED_OTHER    -- this is non-premptive, but otherwise may or may not
 *                         be the same as one of the above.  According to
 *                         POSIX, it is provided so that applications can
 *                         "indicate that they no longer need a realtime
 *                         scheduling policy".
 *
 *                         SCHED_OTHER may have a priority value, though its
 *                         meaning os implementation defined.  It may have
 *                         other, implementation defined, parameters.
 *
 *       SCHED_SPORADIC -- this is an optional policy, not further considered
 *                         here.  However, it uses three further fields in the
 *                         scheduling params -- which confirms the need to
 *                         handle those as "partly opaque".
 *
 *     The POSIX "struct sched_param" contains only one known entry -- the
 *     priority -- except for SCHED_SPORADIC, for which three other entries are
 *     specified.  The min and max allowed priorities are given by
 *     sched_get_priority_min() and sched_get_priority_max() for the policy
 *     in question.
 *
 *     This whole area is implementation and system specific, so here we use
 *     the defaults as given.  If at some point some configuration options
 *     are implemented to override the default, then extra facilities will
 *     be required to apply those.
 *
 *   * inherit scheduling properties
 *
 *     The default for this is implementation defined.  Linux man page for
 *     pthread_attr_setschedinherit() says that PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED is the
 *     default.
 *
 *     The properties inherited are (by POSIX): scope, policy and params.
 *
 *     The effect on scope, policy and params of clearing the inherit option
 *     (ie setting PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED) is not defined.
 *
 *     If the inherit option is set by default, what are the scope, policy
 *     and params set to ?  Given that a single set of attributes may be used
 *     many times, presumably the attributes are *not* the attributes that will
 *     be inherited (since many threads could use the attribute set).  So,
 *     are they undefined or are they the default attributes (so that clearing
 *     the inherit option naturally takes them) ?  Or does clearing the inherit
 *     option have a side effect which sets the policy and params ?  Or does
 *     clearing the inherit option require the policy and params to be set
 *     explicitly ?  If the last, how do we establish what policy and
 *     params (particularly for SCHED_OTHER) should be adopted ?
 *
 *     Given that we feel that PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM is the appropriate scope,
 *     how do we ensure that is what is asked for, given that we have no idea
 *     how to set the policy and params ?
 *
 *     Finally, is it possible that *different* policy and params are suitable
 *     for the two contention scopes ?  Would PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS be running
 *     SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO ?  Or some policy quite different ?
 *
 *     Would the scheduling policy and params of the main thread be a suitable
 *     default for PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM ?
 *
 *     What is more, it may or may not be necessary to have special privileges
 *     in order to change the scheduling properties.
 *
 *     Who can tell ?
 *
 *     See qpt_thread_init() for the chosen approach to inheritance and
 *     default scope/policy/param.
 *
 *   * guardsize, stackaddr & stacksize
 *
 *     These can only be set at pthread creation time.
 *
 *     We use the defaults.  No support is currently provided for changing
 *     any of these.
 *
 *   * cancel state & type   -- settable once the pthread starts running.
 *
 *     The default cancel state and type are PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE and
 *     PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED.
 *
 *     At present there is no qpt_thread_cancel(), so the cancel state and
 *     type are moot.
